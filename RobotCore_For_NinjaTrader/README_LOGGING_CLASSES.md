# RobotLogEvent and RobotLoggingService

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are COPIES from Authoritative Source

`RobotLogEvent.cs` and `RobotLoggingService.cs` in this folder are **COPIES** of the authoritative source.

**Authoritative Source:**
- `modules/robot/core/RobotLogEvent.cs`
- `modules/robot/core/RobotLoggingService.cs`

## ⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY

**All edits must be made in the authoritative source**, then copied here.

This copy exists because NinjaTrader compiles source files directly (not via DLL reference).

## Sync Process

When making changes:

1. **Edit:** `modules/robot/core/RobotLogEvent.cs` or `RobotLoggingService.cs`
2. **Copy:** Copy the changes to `RobotCore_For_NinjaTrader/` versions
3. **Verify:** Both files remain identical (except for the header comments)

## Why Copies Instead of Links?

Symbolic links require administrator privileges on Windows. Since NinjaTrader needs source files directly, we use copies with prominent warnings to prevent drift.

**Future Improvement:** Consider a build script to auto-sync these files.
