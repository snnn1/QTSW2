## Robot execution contracts (drift prevention)

Robot behavior is governed by these contracts:

- `docs/robot/NinjaTrader Robot Blueprint (Execution Layer).txt`
- `configs/analyzer_robot_parity.json`
- `docs/robot/ANALYZER_ROBOT_PARITY_TABLE.md`

Governance rule:

**Analyzer execution change → update parity spec/table → update Robot.**
